# most_active_cookie
Given a CSV file of cookies and the corresponding timestamps, parse the file and output the most active cookie used in a given day. Uses Java 11 and is intended to be run on a Linux file system.
You can call either of two bash scripts to start the program or run the provided test cases. 
To start the program, you can call: ./most_active_cookie some_cookie_log_file.csv -d yyyy-MM-dd
To start my provided tests, you can call ./most_active_cookie_test

Note, I needed to call sudo chmod 754 most_active_cookie to give the bash script permission to execute my Java files. You may need to that as well.
Thank you!
